# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Matthew Eiley

I'm a software engineering student and aspiring quantitative engineer passionate about building tools that sit at the intersection of code, math, and markets.

## ðŸ”¬ What Iâ€™m Working On

- ðŸ§  **Options Pricing Engine**  
  A modular Python engine supporting Black-Scholes, Black-76, Garman-Kohlhagen, Kirk's Approximation, and Bjerksund-Stensland models for pricing European, American, FX, and spread options.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Quantitative Trading Algorithms**  
  I develop systematic trading strategiesâ€”from momentum-based equity rotation to fully automated signal-driven systems. My focus is on data-driven logic, backtesting reliability, and clean execution architecture.

- ðŸ“„ **LaTeX Without the Pain â€” â€˜Sintâ€™**  
  I like writing long-form technical documents, but hate LaTeX syntax. So I built **Sint**â€”a simplified markup language and Python interpreter that compiles intuitive syntax into professional LaTeX.
