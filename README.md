# Hi, I'm Matthew Eiley
I'm a Software engineering student passionate about quantitative finance, data-driven systems, and building tools that solve real problems. I work at the intersection of math, code, and markets, with projects that span options pricing engines, algorithmic trading tools, custom interpreters, and physical health analytics. I'm always exploring new ways to find patterns in noisy data.

I also make my own soap.

## What I’m Working On

- **Options Pricing Engine**  
  A modular Python engine supporting Black-Scholes, Black-76, Garman-Kohlhagen, Kirk's Approximation, and Bjerksund-Stensland models for pricing European, American, FX, and spread options.<br/>

- **Quantitative Trading Algorithm**  
  Developed a quantitative trading algorithm that generates and executes trades based on systematic, data-driven signals and backtested performance.
  Though my implementation is private, view my portfolio's performance below:<br/>

- **Health Analytics Dashboard**  
  A personal health insights tool that pulls data from my [WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com/ca/en/) to visualize recovery, sleep, strain, and HRV trends. Includes GitHub-style heatmaps and performance summaries to optimize training and rest.<br/>

- **LaTeX Without the Pain**  
  I like writing long-form technical documents, but hate LaTeX syntax. So I built SINT (Simple and Intuitive Notation for Technical Writing) — a markup language and Python interpreter that compiles more natural syntax into professional LaTeX.<br/>

- **Hedge Fund Wesbite**  
  Leading the development of the website for Martlet Fund McGill, a student-run hedge fund. The site will showcase fund strategy, member programs, published research, and alumni success.<br/>
