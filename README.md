# Hi, I'm Matthew Eiley
I'm a Software engineering student passionate about quantitative finance, data-driven systems, and building tools that solve real problems. I work at the intersection of math, code, and markets, with projects that span finance, mathematics, physical health, and more. I'm always exploring new ways to find patterns in noisy data.

I also make my own soap.

## What I’m Working On

- **Quantitative Trading Algorithm**  
  Developed a quantitative trading algorithm that generates and executes trades based on systematic, data-driven signals and backtested performance.

- **Tax Optimization AI Engine for Canadians**  
  A Python-based AI engine that analyzes client profiles and applies advanced Canadian tax strategies using RBC, CRA, and Revenu Québec sources. Generates personalized, advisor-ready reports and creates a custom-trained AI chatbot per client to deliver proactive, tailored planning insights for individuals and family offices.

- **Health Analytics Dashboard**  
  A personal health insights tool that pulls data from my [WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com/ca/en/) to visualize recovery, sleep, strain, and HRV trends. Includes GitHub-style heatmaps and performance summaries to optimize training and rest.<br/>

- **Zetamac-Style Arithmetic Game**
  A Python-based app that allows users to play a Zetamac-style mental math game. Uses a modular logic engine to parse and solve each question type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and tracks historical game records, recording user's scores and rankings to simulate and test mathematical performance under timed pressure.<br/>

- **LaTeX Without the Pain**  
  I like writing long-form technical documents, but hate LaTeX syntax. So I built SINT (Simple and Intuitive Notation for Technical Writing), a markup language and Python interpreter that compiles more natural syntax into professional LaTeX.<br/>
