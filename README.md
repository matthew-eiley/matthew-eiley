# Hi, I'm Matthew Eiley

I'm a software engineering student and aspiring quant who is passionate about building tools that sit at the intersection of code, math, and financial markets.

## What I’m Working On

- **Options Pricing Engine**  
  A modular Python engine supporting Black-Scholes, Black-76, Garman-Kohlhagen, Kirk's Approximation, and Bjerksund-Stensland models for pricing European, American, FX, and spread options.<br/>

- **Quantitative Trading Algorithms**  
  I develop systematic trading strategies—from momentum-based equity rotation to fully automated signal-driven systems. My focus is on data-driven logic, backtesting reliability, and clean execution architecture.<br/>

- **LaTeX Without the Pain — ‘Sint’**  
  I like writing long-form technical documents, but hate LaTeX syntax. So I built Sint — a simplified markup language and Python interpreter that compiles intuitive syntax into professional LaTeX.<br/>

- **Hedge Fund Wesbite**  
  Leading the development of the website for Martlet Fund McGill, a student-run hedge fund. The site will showcase fund strategy, member programs, published research, and alumni success.<br/>
